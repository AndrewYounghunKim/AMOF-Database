# AMOF-Database

## About This Project
<img src="images/image.jpg">
This work introduces first comprehensive Amorphous Metal-Organic Framework database. Using chemically validated reactive force field (ReaxFF) simulations, we generated 500 structurally durable AMOFs. Leveraging this dataset, we trained a machine learning model to predict the amorphization propensity of crystalline MOFs and identified key structural descriptors that govern this transformation. Additionally, we conducted a high-throughput screening of the AMOFs for their suitability in COâ‚‚ Direct Air Capture (DAC) and identified four promising candidates exhibiting DAC-favorable features that emerged only after amorphization
